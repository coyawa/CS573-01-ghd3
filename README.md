- Idea
	- My design idea came from a famous puzzle game <span id="inline-blue">Tangram</span>;  Chinese <span id="inline-green">七巧板</span>; literally: "seven boards of skill". 
	- Everyone can use these boards to make many stuff you like, especially for children, they have a fantastic imagination.
- Why
	- Our topic is shapes, the tangram is the game you can use boards to form many specific shapes like man, bird,.etc
- Tool
	- Code: Sublime Text 3
	- Prototype: 53 Paper with Apple Pencil
	- Write: MWeb
	- Color Pick: Sip

- Screenshots

#### Technical Achievement
- Interactive: the shapes are draggable and move to the canvas, and form different stuff with your idea.
- Use D3 Drag function with feature the circles can not be dragged out of the canvas.
	 
#### Design Achievement
- This is an original idea to show tangram with D3.js, there are less sample can be found with google.
- The work include 9 colors to attract the user to run this demo.
- There is some description about the tangram puzzle.

#### For Me
- This is a good start to me to learn D3.js and JavaScript, I will keep update this work, make it more perfect with the whole function.
- Learn from other classmates beautiful works.
- Next move: fix the draggable issue, add "control + mouse" rotate function.
